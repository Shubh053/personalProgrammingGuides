1. == => means content comparison and is ==> means reference comparison.
2. chr(unicode) ==> character and ord(char) ==> unicode
3. list cannot be used as key for dictionary but tuple can be used as a key.


INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
-----------------------
1. Python was developed by Guido Van Rossam in 1989 in National Institute Of Research in Neitherland.
2. Python officially released in 20th Feb 1991.
3. Python is named after Monty Python's Circus show in BBC.
4. Procedural or functional programming is picked by C language.
5. OOP programming is picked by C++ language.
6. Scripting programming is picked by Pearl and Shell.
7. Modular programming is picked by Modula-3.
8. Python syntax is inspired by C and ABC language.

2. Mobile applications



FLAVORS OF PYTHON
------------------
1. CPython (Standard version) - to work with c language
2. Jython or JPython - to work with java language
3. IronPython - to work with c# language
4. Pypy - for more performance bcoz it have JIT compiler by default
5. RubyPython - to work with ruby language
6. AnacondaPython - to handle big data
7. Stackless (Python for concurrency) - for multithreading



PYTHON VERSIONS
----------------
1. Python 1.0 introduced in jan 1994
2. Python 2.0 introduced in oct 2000
3. Python 3.0 introduced in dec 2008



RULES TO DEFINE IDENTIFIERS
----------------------------
1. Alphabet symbols (both upper and lower case), Digits (0 to 9), Underscore (_)
2. Idenitfier should not start with digit
3. Python is case-sensetive
4. No length limit for python identifiers
5. If identifier starts with _ indicates private
6. If identifier starts with __ indicates strongly private
7. Starts with __ and ends with __ symbol indicates it is language specific identifier



RESERVED WORDS
---------------
1. 33 reserved words
2. True, False, None
3. and, or , not, is
4. if, else, elif
5. while, for, break, continue, return, in, yield
6. try, except, finally, raise, assert
7. import, from, as, class, def, pass, global, nonlocal, lambda, del, with
8. import keyword  
   keyword.kwlist()  # to print keyword list



DATA TYPES
-----------
1. int => binary (0 and 1) 0b, decimal (base-10 0 to 9), octal (0 to 7) 0o, hexadecimal (0 to 9, a to f / A to F) 0x
2. float
3. complex => can't be converted to int or float using type casting
4. bool
5. str
6. bytes => immutable
7. bytearray => mutable
8. range => immutable
9. list => ordered, duplicates allowed, mutable
10. tuple => ordered, duplicates allowed, immutable
11. set => unordered, duplicates not allowed, mutable
12. frozenset => unordered, duplicates not allowed, immutable
13. dict => unordered, key duplicates not allowed but values can be duplicates, mutable
14. None



TYPE CASTING / TYPE COERSION
-----------------------------
1. int() => any other fundamental data type can be converted to int except complex and if it's a string then it should be compulsory base-10
2. float() => any other fundamental data type can be converted to float except complex and if it's a string then it should be compulsory base-10
3. complex() => there are two forms of type casting in complex:
                1. complex(x) => here x will be the real part
                2. complex(x, y) => here x will be the real part and y will be the imaginary part, if it's a string then 2nd argument will throw TypeError.
4. bool() => for int and float type, 0 means False and all other non-zero value means True. for complex if both real and imaginary part is 0 then False. for string if arg is empty then False.
5. str() =>

4. symmetric_difference or ^ ==> returns a set that contains all items from both sets, except items that are present in both sets.
5. difference_update() ==> removes the items that exist in both sets. its diffrent from difference() method, because the difference() returns a new set and difference_update() removes the unwanted items from the original set.
6. intersection_update() ==> removes the unwanted items i.e, which are not present in both sets from the original set.
7. symmetric_difference_update() ==>

FUNCTIONS EXPECTING ANOTHER FUNCTION AS ARGUMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
1. filter() ==> filter(function, sequence), this is used to filter out elements from the sequence based on true or false condition by using function.
2. map() ==> map(function, sequence), for performing a functionality on every element of sequence map function is used.it can be applied on multiple sequence too but every sequence should have same number of elements if not equal then extra elements will be ignored.
3. reduce() ==> reduce(function, sequence), is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements.it takes first two elements of sequence and result obtained next it apply the same function to previous result and next element, this process is continued till no element left in sequence then the final result is printed.

NESTED FUNCTIONS
-----------------

FUNCTION DECORATORS
--------------------
1. A decorator is a function which takes another function as input and gives a function as output with added functionality.
2. To automatically call decorator then use @decor function.



MODULES
--------
1. A group of functions and variables saved to a file.
2. import module1 ==> importing single module

2. finally block will execute always wheather exception raised or not raised, handled or not handled.
3. with try block either except or finally block is compulsory.
4. try-1, except-multiple, else-1, finally-1 blocks allowed in a chain.
5. for else block except block must be there.
6. finally without try is invalid.
7. except without try is invalid.
8. we can nest try-except-else-finally in try,except,else,finally blocks.



TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS
--------------------
1. Predefined exceptions/ Inbuilt exceptions
2. User defined exceptions

Predefined exceptions/ Inbuilt exceptions
------------------------------------------
1. The exceptions which are raised automatically by python whenever a particular event occurs. eg, ZeroDivisonError, ValueError etc

User defined exceptions
------------------------
1. Make a class to define the exception then raise it. 
   eg, class TooYoungException(Exception):
           def __init__(self, arg):
               self.msg = arg

       input(int("Enter your age: "))
